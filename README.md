# Guardian-Garage-Opener
Garage opener which opens automatically once a toxic level of carbon monoxide is in the garage
The Project utilizes an arduino uno, a relay, battery, MQ7 sensor, garage opener circuit board, a switch and a bunch of wires

The reason of this project is for preventing people from passing away due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a car in a garage
The device constantly monitors Co levels and once a concerning level is present, the device will automatically open the garage to reduce the amount of co. 

Next steps for this project is to contain it in a box and possibly create a pcb for a demo product.

The goal of the project is to create this product and make it a standard in todays garage machines.
